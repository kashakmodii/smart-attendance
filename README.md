## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Frontend       | Backend          | Database / Storage     |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| HTML, CSS, JS  | Python (OpenCV)  | Excel (.xlsx via `openpyxl` or `pandas`) |

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The system opens a webcam interface via the browser.
2. Captured images are sent to a Python backend for face detection and matching.
3. If matched, the attendance is marked in an Excel file with date and time.
4. The UI displays attendance confirmation or error messages.
